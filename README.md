# Ozzie the Ossifrage's Magic Decks

Proud homebrewer of Pioneer decks for Magic the Gathering. Izzet is my home pair but I'm known to be dangerous with any deck with red in its colors.

### Duplidrakes
Izzet midrange with a focus on creature combat & milling spells to empower crackling drakes (you duplicate these)

### The Boys
Boros heroic with a special focus on protecting your boys while you build them as tall as you can.

### Wit's End
Dimir... uh I guess it's midrange? Just hit ur opponent a lot and use those on-hit effects to get that W.
